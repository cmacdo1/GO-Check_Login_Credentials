# GO-Check_Login_Credentials
Checks the credentials of a user logging in.
Login and Password are hardcoded into the program.
Allows 3 retries for the user if the first attempt is incorrect.  
This project is to demonstrate the correct use of Go syntax, 
correctly apply conditional statements and iterations (loops), 
and to create and apply functions.
